# MongoDB Aggregation Pipeline Bug

This repository demonstrates a common error in MongoDB aggregation pipelines: Incorrect use of the $group stage resulting in inaccurate data aggregation. The `bug.js` file shows the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.js` provides the corrected version.

## Bug Description
The aggregation pipeline attempts to group documents and count their occurrences; however, due to a missing field in the $group stage, it produces inaccurate results.  The incorrect pipeline produces a count that doesn't accurately represent the number of items in the groups.  This would lead to incorrect reporting on various data and analytics results.

## Solution
The corrected pipeline in `bugSolution.js` includes the necessary field to ensure the $group stage performs the count as intended.
